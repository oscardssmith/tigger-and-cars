This is a 3D variation of the classic “asteroids” game. The Tigger will have 6 lives represented by 3D hearts on the top left corner of the screen. The Tigger will be able to move horizontally and vertically within a 4x4 grid on the floor and jump according to simulated laws of physics. The goal of the game will be to try to avoid cars. Cars will be generated more frequently and will move faster as the game progresses. The user’s score will depend on the time they last before they lose all 6 lives. The user will lose a life if they hit into a car. The best score will be saved in a text file and displayed on the top of the page along with the current score.
